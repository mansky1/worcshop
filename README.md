# WorCshop README

WorCshop is a VSCode extension for proving the correctness of C code as you write it.

## Features

Right now, all it does is send the most recent line you typed to Coq at every newline and use Alectryon to render the resulting proof state.

## Requirements

Requires [Alectryon](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon). Will also require [VST](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST/) eventually.
