# WorCshop README

WorCshop is a VSCode extension for proving the correctness of C code as you write it.

## Features

Right now, all it does is send the most recent line you typed to Coq at every newline and log the goal state as reported by SerAPI.

## Requirements

Currently requires [SerAPI](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi). Will also require [VST](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST/) and [Alectryon](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon) eventually.
